# guild.ai

This project is the website for Guild AI. It is a modified version of
the [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) website from
https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org.

# Developing

The website is a Nuxt.js application that requires an documentation
API server. Start the server by following the instructions here:

https://github.com/guildai/docs.

Once the documentation API server is running, start the website server
(this project) by running:

```bash
make serve
```

Most changes made to the website will update immediately in the
browser. Changes to documentation require a page refresh.
