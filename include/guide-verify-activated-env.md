!!! note
    Before installing a Python package for a project, verify that
    your project environment is activated by checking the command
    prompt. The prompt should contain the environment name in the form
    `(<env name>) <default prompt>`. If it does not run ``source
    guild-env`` from the project directory to activate the
    environment.
    <p>
    When a Python package and its dependencies are installed in
    an activated environment, the packages are installed within the
    environment directory rather than a user or system directory. They
    are not visible to other environments, which avoids package
    version conflicts.
