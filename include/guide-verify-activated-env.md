!!! note
    Before installing a Python package for a project, verify that
    your project environment is activated by checking the command
    prompt. The prompt should contain the environment name in the form
    `(<env name>) <default prompt>`. If it does not run ``source
    guild-env`` from the project directory to activate the
    environment.
