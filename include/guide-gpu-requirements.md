- GPU accelerated system

Many of the operations run in this guide are not feasible without a
GPU accelerated system. If you don't have access to a GPU, consider
using a GPU accelerated server or container from AWS, Google Cloud,
Microsoft Azure, and others.

If your GPU accelerated system is remote, run the commands in this
guide over SSH while connect to that system.
