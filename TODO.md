# To do

## 0.7 Working list

- We don't link to examples anywhere. These are like cheatsheets.

- Be systematic about linking to examples and cheatsheets.

- Need a flag function reference - move reference material from flags
  concept (/flags.md) to a reference
  (e.g. /reference/flag-functions.md)

- Make sure that each page is tagged correctly.

- Major work needed on /guildfile.md - see TODOs in that page.

- About page

- For release:

  - Make sure versions are correct
  - Replace www-pre links with the real thing

- Go through production www and make sure we copy over any useful
  content.

- Make sure clicky ID is prod on release.

- Missing section on env variables.

- Put EXAMPLES at top with links to code examples and cheatsheets.

- Need a good guide for Dependencies.

  https://www-pre.guild.ai/dependencies/ is not complete as it fails
  to talk about how these are used by the user.
