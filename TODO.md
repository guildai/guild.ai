# To do

## Working list

- Need a flag function reference - move reference material from flags
  concept (/flags.md) to a reference
  (e.g. /reference/flag-functions.md)

## 0.7 Tagline

Want strategic value

Want to appeal to the people most likely to use experiment tracking

I personally want to capture the researchers, but maybe not

Profile of someone who would use this tool

- Works in industry with some past or ongoing academic work
- Works alone
- Likes Guild because it's well designed

The value prop is that


```



```

Trying to capture:

- What is this thing? (literal)
- Why would I want to use this thing? (individual benefit)
- I know why I want it, how is it different? (comparative)
- How can my organization benefit? (organizational fit)
