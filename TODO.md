# To do

## Working list

- We don't link to examples anywhere. These are like cheatsheets.

- Be systematic about linking to examples and cheatsheets.

- Need a flag function reference - move reference material from flags
  concept (/flags.md) to a reference
  (e.g. /reference/flag-functions.md)

- Make sure that each page is tagged correctly.

- Major work needed on /guildfile.md - see TODOs in that page.

- About page

- For release:

  - Make sure versions are correct
  - Replace www-pre links with the real thing

- Go through production www and make sure we copy over any useful
  content.

- Make sure clicky ID is prod on release.

## 0.7 Tagline

Want strategic value

Want to appeal to the people most likely to use experiment tracking

I personally want to capture the researchers, but maybe not

Profile of someone who would use this tool

- Works in industry with some past or ongoing academic work
- Works alone
- Likes Guild because it's well designed

The value prop is that


```



```

Trying to capture:

- What is this thing? (literal)
- Why would I want to use this thing? (individual benefit)
- I know why I want it, how is it different? (comparative)
- How can my organization benefit? (organizational fit)

- [ ] Missing copy on index page
  - [ ] Something on end-to-end learning

- [ ] Features details page

Maybe use a wizard interface - use it gauge what people click on and
how long they stay. Confirm that clicky can track this.
