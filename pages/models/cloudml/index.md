# Cloud ML

Google's Cloud Machine Learning Engine (Cloud ML) can be used to train
and deploy TensorFlow models. The models below are provided by the
Cloud ML team as working examples that you can experiment and learn
from in developing your own.

Cloud ML enabled models can be trained locally or in the cloud. They
make use of Guild AI's [Cloud ML plugin](/docs/plugins/cloudml/) to
start and manage remote runs such as training or predicting.
