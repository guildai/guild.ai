# Keras

[Keras ->](https://keras.io/) is an independent neural networks API
that has been adopted as a core interface to TensorFlow. Keras
provides a number of excellent [models
->](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples), many of
which have been adapted as Guild packages.

Keras models are supported without modification. You can specify
training epochs, batch size, and model hyper parameters without
editing Keras scripts. Guild AI also enables TensorFlow event logging
for models so you can view training metrics using
[TensorBoard](/docs/visual/tensorboard/).
