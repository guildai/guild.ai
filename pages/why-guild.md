<h3 id="start" class="why">Guild AI is the easiest way to track experiments</h3>

Just run your script.

``` command
guild run train.py
```

With one command, you automatically record:

- Experiment inputs
- Experiment results
- Snapshot of source code

If you need to customize anything, Guild lets you add [external
configuration](https://my.guild.ai/docs/guildfiles) without changing
your code.

<h3 id="open-source" class="why">100% open source</h3>

Guild AI is available under the [Apache 2 open source
license](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). You
have full rights to use Guild source code --- review it, change it,
share it with others.

Guild AI is not affiliated with a platform vendor. There's no
bait-and-switch or hidden allegiance. Guild AI is an independent, open
source company committed to empowering ML engineers with world-class
tools.

<h3 id="no-code-change" class="why">No code change required</h3>

Don't change your code just to track experiments. Guild adapts to your
code with smart configuration. Avoid pointless changes to your code
and stay independent.

<h3 id="no-deps" class="why">No databases, exotic file systems, or agents</h3>

Guild is free of complicated requirements.

- *No databases* --- If your experiment tracking system requires that
  you install, configure, and maintain systems like MongoDB, think
  twice.

- *No exotic file systems* --- Storing an experiment should be
  straight forward. It shouldn't require exotic file systems. If a
  tool requires anything beyond a standard mounted drive, think twice.

- *No agents* --- Experiments should just run, every time, without
  talking to a back-end service to capture results. If your experiment
  tracker talks to an agent, think twice.

<h3 id="community" class="why">Incredible community of ML engineers</h3>

The [community of Guild AI users](https://my.guild.ai) share a common
vision.

- *Measure* --- Memory and intuition only take you so far. Measure
  results to systematically improve models and avoid costly
  regressions.

- *Automate* --- Manual steps are tedious and error-prone. Automate
  tasks to go faster and avoid costly mistakes.

- *Repeat* --- Engineers work with data scientists in joint-ownership
  of code. Anyone can run operations at any time to recreate and
  confirm results.

- *Improve* --- Work fast, measure, and iterate. This is the essence
  of [*Test Driven
  Development*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).
  It's the key to effective software delivery.
