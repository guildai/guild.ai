<h3 class="why">Guild AI is the easiest way to track experiments</h3>

Just run your script!

``` command
guild run my_training_script.py
```

With one command, you automatically record:

- Experiment inputs
- Experiment results
- Snapshot of source code

If you need to customize anything related to your script, Guild lets
you add [external configuration](ref:guildfile) without changing your
code.

<h3 class="why">It's also the most powerful</h3>

Don't let Guild's ease-of-use fool you --- Guild is a full-featured
platform for ML engineering.

- Run analysis, visualization, and diffing
- Pipeline automation
- Hyperparameter tuning with AutoML
- Scheduling
- Parallel processing
- Remote training, backup, and restore

<h3 class="why">Guild AI is 100% open source</h3>

Guild is free software, released under the [Apache 2 open source
license
->](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). That
means you don't pay money to use Guild. It also means you have full
rights to use Guild source code --- review it, change it, share it
with others. We're also happy to accept [pull requests!](ref:prs)

Guild AI is not affiliated with a platform vendor --- so there's no
bait-and-switch or hidden allegiance. Guild AI developers are
committed to empowering ML engineers with world-class, open source
tools --- *period*.

<h3 class="why">No databases, exotic file systems, or agents</h3>

Guild goes to great lengths to remain simple and free of complicated
requirements:

- *No databases* --- If your experiment tracking system requires that
  you install, configure, and maintain complicated systems MongoDB,
  think twice. You don't need it.

- *No exotic file systems* --- Storing an experiment is straight
  forward and doesn't a require fancy file system like HDFS. If a tool
  requires anything beyond a standard mounted drive, think twice. You
  don't need it.

- *No agents* --- Your experiments should just run, each time, without
  talking to a back-end service to capture results. Not only do you
  need to install and configure the back-end, you need to make sure
  it's *always available*. If your experiment tracker requires a
  back-end, think twice. You don't need it.

<h3 class="why">Community of ML engineers</h3>

The growing [community of Guild AI users ->](ref:slack) value:

- *Measurement* --- Memory and intuition will only take you so far. To
  systematically improve your models and to avoid costly regressions,
  engineers measure results and use the data to make informed
  decisions.

- *Automation* --- Manual steps are tedious and error prone. Engineers
  automate tasks to run them faster and avoid costly mistakes.

- *Repeatability* --- Engineers work with data scientists in
  joint-ownsership of code, which means anyone can run model
  operations to confirm them and detect issues before models are
  deployed to production.

- *Continuous Incremental Improvement* --- Start with a process for
  quickly running and measuring your work and use that to make
  ongoing, small changes to improve. This method is at the heart of
  [Test Driven Development
  ->](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), which is
  at the heart of effective software delivery.
