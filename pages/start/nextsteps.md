# Next Steps

TODO:

Point to guides:

- Add Guild to Project

- Updraging from Previous Versions

- Examples

- Cheatsheets

- Tips & Techniques

- Remote guides

Possibly structure this with a split: people who use Notebooks vs
people who are automating things. Use this as a way to think about
user scenarios.
