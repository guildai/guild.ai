# Add a Classifier

[TOC]

## Overview

In the [previous section](/start/guildfile.md), you use a Guild file
to define a `train` operation. In this section, you enhance the
project by adding a real-world classifier.

You cover:

- Multiple [models](term:model) in a single project
- Guild [environments](term:environment) to isolate project work

## Download Classifier Script

[Download
`plot_iris_exercise.py`](ext:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guildai/examples/master/iris-svm/plot_iris_exercise.py)
and save it to the `guild-start` directory.

The script [^iris-script] trains a model on the Iris benchmark data set.

[^iris-script]: The classifier added in this section is adapted from
[*scikit-learn SVM Exercise*
->](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/exercises/plot_iris_exercise.html)

The `guild-start` directory should look like this:

<div class="file-tree">
<ul>
<li class="is-folder open">guild-start
 <ul>
 <li class="is-folder">archived-runs</li>
 <li class="is-file">guild.yml</li>
 <li class="is-file">plot_iris_exercise.py</li>
 <li class="is-file">train.yml</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Add `iris-svm` Model to guild.yml

In the `guild-start` directory, modify `guild.yml` by adding the
`iris-svn` model below.

The final modified `guild.yml` should be:

``` yaml
- model: sample
  description: A sample model
  operations:
    train:
      description: Sample training script
      main: train
      flags-import: all
      output-scalars: '(\key): (\value)'

- model: iris-svm
  description: Iris classifier using a support vector machine (SVM)
  operations:
    train:
      description: Train SVM model on Iris data set
      main: plot_iris_exercise
      flags:
        kernel:
          description: SVM kernel type
          default: rbf
          choices: [linear, poly, rbf]
        test_split:
          description: Percentage of examples held out for test
          default: 0.2
        random_seed:
          description: Seed used for shuffling data
          default: 0
        degree:
          description: Degree of the poly kernel function
          default: 3
        gamma:
          description: Kernel coefficient for rbf and poly
          default: 10
      output-scalars:
        train_accuracy: 'Train accuracy: (\value)'
        test_accuracy: 'Test accuracy: (\value)'
```

^ `guild.yml` after adding `iris-svm` model

The file defines two models: `sample` and `iris-svm`. The `sample`
model provides the `train` operation from the [previous
step](/start/guildfile.md). The `iris-svm` is a new model, which you
add in this section.

!!! highlight
    Use models to group related sets of operations. Models
    generally correspond to the structures that you train and test
    with data, though you're free to define models for other
    purposes. For more information, see [*Models*](ref:models).

The Guild file format changes from a mapping of operations ([operation
only format](term:operation-only-format)) to a list of top-level
objects ([full format](term:full-format)). Guild supports both formats
to accommodate different requirements. Use *operation only format*
when starting to keep your Guild file as simple as possible. Migrate
to *full format* as needed to support more configuration. For more
information, see [*Guild File Reference*](/reference/guildfile.md).

Below is a description of the `iris-svm:train` attributes.

`description`
: A description of the operation.

`main`
: The Python module that implements the operation.

`flags`
: A mapping of flag *name* to flag *definition*. Each flag provides a
  description, which is used in help text, and a default value. The
  `kernel` flag defines a list of valid *choices* --- one for each
  supported kernel. For more information, see [*Flags*](/flags.md).

`output-scalars`
: Patterns used to capture [output scalars](term:output-scalar). In
  this case, the capture patterns are different from those of
  `sample:train`. This accommodates the different output generated by
  the module.

!!! highlight
    Rather than require changes to `plot_iris_exercise.py`
    to support Guild-specific output patterns, Guild lets you change
    `guild.yml`. This keeps your project source code independent of
    external tooling.

Verify that the operations are available:

``` command
guild ops
```

``` output
iris-svm:train  Train SVM model on Iris data set
sample:train    Generate a sample loss
```

!!! note
    The [ops](cmd:ops) command is a shortened alias for
    [operations](cmd:operations).

If you don't see `iris-svm:fit` in the list, verify that `guild.yml`
is the same as above and that you're running the command from
`guild-start`.

Show the project models:

``` command
guild models
```

``` output
iris-svm  Iris classifier using a support vector machine (SVM)
sample    A sample model
```

Show help for the project:

``` command
guild help
```

``` output
OVERVIEW

    You are viewing help for operations defined in the current directory.

    To run an operation use 'guild run OPERATION' where OPERATION is one
    of options listed below. If an operation is associated with a model,
    include the model name as MODEL:OPERATION.

    To list available operations, run 'guild operations'.

    Set operation flags using 'FLAG=VALUE' arguments to the run command.
    Refer to the operations below for a list of supported flags.

    For more information on running operations, try 'guild run --help'.
    For general information, try 'guild --help'.

    Use a Guild file to document your project capabilities
    to help others use it effectively.

## Create a Guild Environment

Up to this point, you have run experiments in the default Guild
environment, which stores runs under your user directory.

In this section, you create a project-specific
[environment](term:environment) to keep project libraries and runs
separate from other projects. See [*Use project specific virtual
environments*](/guides/tips-and-techniques.md#use-project-specific-virtual-environments)
for a list of benefits from using environments.

### Create `requirements.txt`

Guild uses `requirements.txt` to automatically install required
packages when creating an environment.

In the `guild-start` project directory, create a file named
`requirements.txt` that specifies the Python packages required by the
project. The file should be:

``` txt
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

^ `requirements.txt` --- specifies Python packages required by the
project

Your project directory should look like this:

<div class="file-tree">
<ul>
<li class="is-folder open">guild-start
 <ul>
 <li class="is-folder">archived-runs</li>
 <li class="is-file">guild.yml</li>
 <li class="is-file">plot_iris_exercise.py</li>
 <li class="is-file">requirements.txt</li>
 <li class="is-file">train.yml</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Initialize the Environment

Initialize a new environment in the project using [init](cmd:init):

``` command
guild init
```

Guild prompts with the environment settings. Press `Enter` to create
the environment.

Guild initializes a virtual environment in the project under a `venv`
subdirectory.

When the `init` command finishes, the project directory should look
like this:

<div class="file-tree">
<ul>
<li class="is-folder open">guild-start
 <ul>
 <li class="is-folder">archived-runs</li>
 <li class="is-file">guild.yml</li>
 <li class="is-file">plot_iris_exercise.py</li>
 <li class="is-file">requirements.txt</li>
 <li class="is-file">train.yml</li>
 <li class="is-folder">venv</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Activate the Environment

To use an environment, you must *activate* it within each terminal
session that uses it.

Activate the environment:

``` command
source guild-env
```

!!! note
    You can alternatively use the traditional method of
    activating a Python virtual environment, which is to source the
    virtual environment script `bin/activate` --- for example, by
    running ``source venv/bin/activate``. Guild environments are
    standard Python virtual environments.

When you activate an environment, software libraries and runs are
isolated.

Verify that the environment is activated using [check](cmd:check):

``` command
guild check
```

Note the location of ``guild_home`` --- it should be located under the
project directory in ``venv/.guild``.

List the current runs:

``` command
guild runs
```

The list is empty because you haven't generated any runs in current
environment.

## Train the Classifier

In the activated environment, run the `iris-svm:train` operation:

``` command
guild run iris-svm:train
```

``` output
You are about to run iris-svm:train
  degree: 3
  gamma: 10
  kernel: rbf
  random_seed: 0
  test_split: 0.2
Continue? (Y/n)
```

Press `Enter` to start the operation.

Guild runs the operation, which is implemented by the
[`plot_iris_exercise` module
->](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/iris-svm/plot_iris_exercise.py).

Guild uses the default flag values defined for the operation in
`guild.yml`, which you define above.

## View Results

List files generated by the run:

``` command
guild ls
```

``` output
~/guild-start/venv/.guild/runs/c564a767a188438282b925389de45e40:
  plot.png
```

In addition to fitting a model and printing accuracy results, the
operation [generates a plot
->](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/iris-svm/plot_iris_exercise.py#L49-L74)
showing classification results of the Iris test data set.

Open the plot using the default application for your system:

``` command
guild open -p plot.png
```

Guild opens the plot generate by `iris-svm:train`, which shows how
test samples are classified.

<img class="md" src="/assets/img/classifier-plot.png" width="480">

^ Viewing `plot.png` on Linux using Xviewer

Use an alternative program to open a file by specifying the `--cmd`
option. For example, to open `plot.png` in [GIMP
->](https://www.gimp.org/), use:

``` command
guild open -p plot.png --cmd gimp
```

^ Specify the program used to open a file with `--cmd` (this example
  requires that GIMP be installed)

!!! highlight
    Guild integrates with your favorite tools, rather than
    attempt to replace them.

## Experiment with Different Kernels

Run `mnist-svm:train` again using each the other SVM kernels:

``` command
guild run iris-svm:train kernel=[linear,poly]
```

``` output
You are about to run iris-svm:train as a batch (2 trials)
  degree: 3
  gamma: 10
  kernel: [linear, poly]
  random_seed: 0
  test_split: 0.2
Continue? (Y/n)
```

Press `Enter` to confirm.

Guild runs `iris-svm:train` twice --- once for each specified kernel.

## Compare Runs

Use [compare](cmd:compare) to compare results:

``` command
guild compare
```

Use arrow keys to scroll right to view values for
`test_accuracy`. Note that the `linear` kernel performs better the
other two, at least with the default hyperparameters.

Press `q` to exit Guild Compare.

Compare run plots using TensorBoard:

``` command
guild tensorboard --tab images
```

Guild starts TensorBoard and opens the **IMAGES** tab. TensorBoard
shows each of plots generated by the three runs. To improve image
quality, select **Show actual image size** in the upper-left of the
display.

![](/assets/img/classifier-tb.png)

^ Compare run-generated images using TensorBoard

!!! highlight
    Guild automatically shows run-generated images in
    TensorBoard so you don't need to log them as summaries. This is a
    useful way to compare run plots and other images side-by-side.

Return to the command terminal and type `Ctrl-C` to stop TensorBoard.

## Summary

In this section you add `iris-svm` to your project. The model defines
a `train` operation, which runs the Python module `plot_iris_exercise`
to fit a support vector machine to the Iris data set.
