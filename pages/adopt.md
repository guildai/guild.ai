# Adopt a project

*Adopt a project* is a program for students and new machine learning
engineers to both learn from and contribute to an open source paper
implementation. The program supports two goals:

- Improve the reproducibility published results
- Facilitate the use of project code in software applications

Program participants work together to select a project and generate
project artifacts as described below.

## Select a project

- Should be a paper implementation in TensorFlow (though other
  frameworks could be supported)
- Should show signs of life (i.e. commits or issues) in the last six
  months
- May have application potential

## Project artifacts

- Guild file defining project models and operations
- Tutorial style documentation
- Supplementary Python utilities and patches as needed for integration
  with software applications

## Guidelines

- Minimize changes to project source code
- When making changes, use project conventions or canonical Python
  conventions when project convention deviates materially
- Submit pull requests with detailed explanation of goals and benefits
- Document usage scenarios with step-by-step guides
- Minimize questions to project maintainers
- Be friendly and respectful at all times to project maintainers and
  users

## Commitments

- To abide by [Guidelines](#guidelines)
- To fix bugs and answer questions associated with [Project
  artifacts](#project-artifacts) in a timely manner
- To contribute fixes project issues whenever possible
