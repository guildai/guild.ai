    <h3>What is ML Engineering?</h3>

    <p>
      ML engineering is the application of automated methods to
      machine learning. In the tradition of release management,
      continuous integration, and DevOps, it ensure that machine
      learning efforts are measured, recreatable and
      auditable. Effective ML engineering supports fast development of
      performant models while maintaining the highest levels of
      quality.
    </p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Why Guild AI?</h3>

    <p>
      Guild AI is a complete platform for engineers who want to apply
      to machine learning the same control and automation they use in
      other areas. This includes experiment tracking, tools for
      comparison and analysis, hyperparameter tuning, pipeline
      automation, and network operations on any cloud. Guild AI is
      open source, cross platform, and vendor independent.
