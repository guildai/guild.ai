# Guild AI

Guild AI automates TensorFlow and Keras deep learning workflow,
letting you focus on optimizing your models and getting them into
production as quickly as possible. The command line toolset, supports
your deep learning work end-to-end --- from model acquisition, through
training and testing, to deployment. You can even publish your models
for your collaborators to use!

      <h3><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Train</h3>
      <p>

Guild AI automatically records each training experiment, including
saved models, logs, generated artifacts, and run metadata. Use this
information to compare runs and inform your next steps. Is your model
ready to release? Do you need to train again with different data or
hyperparameters? The information you need to make smart decisions is
always on hand.

Guild AI lets you effortlessly compare training results. In addition
to model accuracy and loss, Guild AI provides other information
essential to making informed comparisons including hyperparameters,
model architecture, training steps, and data. Guild even lets you
compare generated artifacts like images and audio to help you quickly
assess each outcome.

      <h3><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> Release</h3>
      <p>

When your model is ready to release, Guild AI has a command that makes
it easy. If you're model is destined for production, Guild lets you
seamlessly deploy to Cloud Machine Learning Engine. If you want to
share your results with colleagues, Guild lets you package and publish
your model so that others can easily reproduce and learn from your
work.
