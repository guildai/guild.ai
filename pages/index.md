    <h5>Model Governance and Auditability</h5>
    <img class="md shadow" src="/assets/img/view-feature.png">
    <p>
      When you develop with Guild, each operation is tracked,
      including source code, hyperparameters, results, and generated
      artifacts. Build with confidence having full governance and
      auditability.

    <h5>Beyond Notebooks</h5>
    <img class="md shadow" src="/assets/img/plot-feature.png">
    <p>
      Where Notebooks summarize a single point in time, Guild captures
      summaries over the entire life cycle of your model. This
      includes associated source code, data, hyperparameters, and
      artifacts.

    <h5>Automated Hyperparameter Tuning</h5>
    <img class="md shadow" src="/assets/img/hparams-2-feature.png">
    <p>
      With Guild it's trivial to start hyperparameter tuning runs for
      any operation. Simpley specify the hyperparameter ranges and
      tell Guild what to optimize and it does the rest.

    <h3>What is ML Engineering?</h3>

    <p>
      ML engineering is the application of control and automated
      methods to machine learning. It follows in the tradition of
      release management, continuous integration, and DevOps to ensure
      that models are not just optimized for performance, but are
      formally measured, recreatable and auditable. Effective ML
      engineering supports faster model development while maintaining
      the highest levels of quality.
    </p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Why Guild AI?</h3>

    <p>
      Guild AI is a complete platform for engineers who want to apply
      to machine learning the same control and automation they use in
      other areas. This includes experiment tracking, tools for
      comparison and analysis, hyperparameter tuning, pipeline
      automation, and network based operation on any cloud. The Guild
      AI platform extends the engineering toolkit to ML development.
