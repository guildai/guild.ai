# Guild AI

Guild AI automates TensorFlow and Keras deep learning workflow,
letting you focus on optimizing your models and getting them into
production as quickly as possible. The command line toolset, supports
your deep learning work end-to-end --- from model acquisition, through
training and testing, to deployment. You can even publish your models
for your collaborators to use!

      <h3><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Train</h3>
      <p>

Guild AI automatically records each training experiment, including
saved models, logs, generated artifacts, and run metadata. Use this
information to compare runs and inform your next steps. Is your model
ready to release, or do you need to train with more data or different
hyperparameters? The information you need to make smart decisions is
always on hand!

      <h3><i class="fa fa-balance-scale"></i> Compare</h3>
      <p>

Guild AI lets you effortlessly compare training results. Along with
model accuracy and loss, Guild AI provides information essential to
making informed comparisons including hyperparameters, model
architecture, training steps, and data. Guild even lets you compare
generated artifacts like images and audio to help you assess each
outcome.

      <h3><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> Release</h3>
      <p>

When your model is ready to release, Guild AI has a command that makes
it easy. If you're model is destined for production, you can
seamlessly deploy to Cloud Machine Learning Engine. If you want to
share your results with colleagues, you can package and publish your
model so that others can easily reproduce and learn from your work.

    <h4>Track experiments</h4>
    <p>

Guild AI automatically saves each training run so you don't have to
worry about losing valuable results. Everything associated with a run
is available for study and use &mdash; saved models, TensorFlow event
logs, generated content, and run metadata.
