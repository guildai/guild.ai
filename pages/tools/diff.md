# Guild Diff

[TOC]

## Overview

Use [diff](cmd:diff) to compares two runs.

By default, Guild diffs the last two runs. You can specify which runs
to diff by specifying the run index or run IDs as arguments.

The following command diffs the last two runs:

``` command
guild diff
```

This is equivalent to the command:

``` command
guild diff 2 1
```

Arguments are specified as `FROM` and `TO`, where `FROM` is the first
run used in the diff and `TO` is the second run. Guild run indexes, as
they appear in run lists (e.g. from ``guild runs``) are listed in
descending order sorted by start time. Therefore to compare runs in
chronological order, use higher to lower run indexes.

To compare a common path within each run, use `--path` or `-p`. For
example, to compare a data file `data.csv` generated by both runs,
run:

``` command
guild compare -p data.csv
```

You can alternatively diff specific parts of two runs using other
options.

`--output`
: Diff run output.

`--source`
: Diff run source code.

`--flags`
: Diff run flags.

For a complete list of options, see [`diff` command
help](/commands/diff.md).

## Diff to Working Source Code

Use the `--working` option to compare run source code to the working
project copy.

``` command
guild diff --working
```

!!! note Guild does not apply `sourcecode` filter rules when diffing
    with `--working`. Guild runs the configured diff program on the
    specified run's source code directory (`.guild/sourcecode`) to the
    project source code root. Files that are excluded using filter
    rules appear in the diff comparison only in the project.

## Diff Programs

When diffing runs or paths, Guild passes the two [run
directories](term:run-dir) or applicable paths to a diff program. By
default, Guild chooses a diff program available on your system based
on its capabilities.

To specify the diff program used, use the `--cmd` or `-c`
option. Guild passes the paths to compare as arguments at the end of
the specified command. For example, to use [Meld](ref:meld) to compare
runs, use:

``` command
guild compare -c meld
```

You can configure the diff program that Guild uses by default in *user
configuration*. For more information, see [User Configuration -
Diff](/reference/user-config.md#diff).
