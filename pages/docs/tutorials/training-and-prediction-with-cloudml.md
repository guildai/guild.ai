# Training and prediction with Cloud ML

[TOC]

In this tutorial, we'll train a model with Google's Cloud Machine
Learning Engine (Cloud ML) and use the trained model to make
prediction.

This tutorial mirrors the steps [Cloud ML Engine - Getting Started
->](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/getting-started-training-prediction) and trains

## Requirements

This tutorial assumes the following:

- Guild AI is [installed and verified](/install)
- [Google Cloud SDK ->](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) is installed
- Your [virtual environment is activated](alias:virtualenv-activate)
  (if applicable)
- You have a working Internet connection

While not required, we recommend using a dedicated virtual environment
for this tutorial. To setup your environment, see
[](alias:tut-env-setup).

## Install the census package

We'll be training a model in the `cloudml.census` package. From a
command line, run:

``` command
guild install cloudml.census
```

You can list the model operations available from the package by
running:

``` command
guild ops cloudml.census
```

``` output
cloudml.census/census-dnn:cloudml-train  Train the classifier on Cloud ML
cloudml.census/census-dnn:train          Train the model locally
```

## Train the model locally

Let's first train the model locally. This will confirm that we can get
a reasonable result locally before training in Cloud ML.

Train the model using 1000 steps by running:

``` command
guild train census train-steps=1000
```

Before proceeding, Guild lets you review the flags used in the
run. Press `ENTER` to start training.

Guild will run the training script, which should finish on most
systems within a minute or two.

## View training results

The training run generates a number of files. We can view them by
running:

``` command
guild runs info --files
```

The [runs info](runs-info) command can be used to view information on
any run. In this case, it shows information about the latest run. The
``--files`` option tells Guild to include file information in the
output.

Let's take a look at the files:

`census-data/`
: Link to census data used for training and test

`checkpoint`
: Latest TensorFlow checkpoint marker

`eval_census-eval/events.out.tfevents.*.omaha`
: TensorFlow event log generated during evaluation

`events.out.tfevents.*.omaha`
: TensorFlow event log generated during training

`export/census/*/saved_model.pb`
: TensorFlow SavedModel

`export/census/*/variables/`
: TensorFlow variables

`graph.pbtxt`
: TensorFlow GraphDef

`model.ckpt-1.*`
: TensorFlow checkpoint at training step 1

`model.ckpt-1000.*`
: TensorFlow checkpoint at training step 1000

`trainer`
: Link to training scripts

We can also use Guild View to view this information. In a
[](alias:separate-console), run:

``` command
guild view
```

This opens a browser window showing you the list of runs for the
census classifier. You can see the list of files for a run by clicking
the **FILES** tab.

You can additionally view the TensorFlow logs by clicking ![View in
TensorBoard](/assets/img/view-in-tensorboard.png) in the upper left of
Guild View.

Keep these windows open as they will automatically update as you
generate more runs.

Note in TensorBoard the model **accuracy**, which can be viewed under
the **SCALARS** tab. The value for our first run should be around 80%.

## Train the model in Cloud ML

Now that we've seen the model train locally, let's train in Cloud ML.

When training in Cloud ML, you need to first create a Cloud Storage
bucket. This will contain the runs generated by Guild.

For instructions, see [Set up your Cloud Storage bucket
->](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/getting-started-training-prediction#set_up_your_cloud_storage_bucket)
in the Cloud ML Getting Started guide.

Verify that you can use `gsutil` to list the contents of your bucket:

``` command
guild gsutil ls BUCKET
```

where ``BUCKET`` is the name of the bucket you will use for Cloud ML
training runs. If you've successfully setup your bucket and have read
access to it, the command should exit without an error.

Train the census classifier in Cloud ML by running:

``` command
guild run census:cloudml-train bucket-name=BUCKET train-steps=1000
```

Replace ``BUCKET`` with the name of the bucket you created earlier.

The `cloudml-train` operation is identical to the `train` operation,
but it is run remotely on Cloud ML rather than locally.

!!! note
    In general, operations are run using the [](cmd:run)
    command. However, we used [](cmd:train) in our previous run. The
    `train` command is an alternative way of running the `train`
    operation (known as an [operation alias](term:operation-alias)).
    It's equivalent to running ``guild run train``. Because
    `cloudml-train` doesn't have an alias we must use the `run`
    command in this case.

The operation will take longer to run because Cloud ML must first
provision a job and wait for TensorFlow to start remotely. This can
take several minutes or more. You can view the run status as it
progresses in the command line console. You can also view status and
log updates from Guild View and TensorBoard.

Guild will routinely synchronize its run status with the remote
job. You can view the updated status in Guild View and TensorBoard.

If Guild becomes disconnected from a remote job --- e.g. you terminate
the command or lose network connectivity --- the job will still run in
Cloud ML. You can synchornize the run status using the [](cmd:sync)
command. If you'd like to reconnect to a running job, use the
``--watch`` option with the command:

``` command
guild sync --watch
```

## Compare runs

As you train each model, you'll want to compare it to previous
runs. Guild's [](cmd:compare) command can be used to quickly sort and
compare training accuracies and loss.

When the `cloudml-train` operation has completed, compare your two
runs by running:

``` command
guild compare
```

You don't need to wait for a run to complete to compare it. If a run
is still in process (i.e. its status is ``running``) you can press
``r`` in Guild Compare to refresh the view with the latest accuracies
and loss.

For a complete list of commands supported by Guild Compare, press
``?``.

To exit Guild Compare, press ``q``.

If you'd like to export the comparison data in [CSV format
->](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) you can run:

``` command
guild compare --csv
```

Next, let's compare run results in TensorBoard. If you still have
TensorBoard open from earlier, it will automatically refresh to
display the current training results. If you need to restart Guild
View, run:

``` command
guild view
```

Click **VIEW IN TENSORBOARD** to open TensorBoard.

You can alternatively open TensorBoard directly using the
[](cmd:tensorboard) command:

```
guild tensorboard
```

The accuracies from the two runs should be similar, provided you used
the same value for `train-steps` in both runs (e.g. ``1000``).
