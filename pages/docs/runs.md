# Runs

[TOC]

## Overview

Runs are generated by running [operations](term:operation). A run may
refer to one of two things:

- Operation system process started with the [](cmd:run) command
- Output generated by a run operation

When you train a model, you generate a run. That run contains the
trained model as well as training logs and other artifacts associated
with the operation.

Similarly, when you fine-tune a model, you generate a run. When you
test a model, you generate a run. In fact, any operation that you run
generates a distinct run. This is how Guild manages your work.

Here is a common work flow:

- Find and install a model
- Run an operation on that model (e.g. `train`)
- Monitor the progress of the operation (e.g. `view`)
- Run another operation with different hyper-parameters (flags)
- Compare runs
- Delete runs that you're no longer interested in
- Select successful runs for deployment or use in other operations

The work centers on *runs* --- creating, comparing, and selecting.

## Start a run

To start a run, use the [](cmd:run) command. The basic format of a
`run` command looks like this:

```
guild run OPERATION
guild run MODEL:OPERATION
guild run PACKAGE/MODEL:OPERATION
```

You can list available operations using the [](cmd:operations)
command. In general, you can omit information about an operation name
as long as Guild can uniquely identify the operation.

For example, if the output of `operations` looks like this:

``` output
iris/iris-cnn:train
iris/iris-cnn:fine-tune
iris/iris-cnn:test
```

You can start the `train` operation by running:

``` command
guild run train
```

You can always provide the model or package. For example, this form
will also start `train`:

``` command
guild run iris-cnn:train
```

You can also use part of the operation specification, as long as Guild
can uniquely identfy the operation. For example, you can start `train`
by running:

```
guild run cnn:train
```

### Operation aliases

Some operations are so common that Guild provides *alias*
commands. These currently include:

- [](cmd:train)

Aliases are used to start operation using these form:

```
guild ALIAS_CMD
guild ALIAS_CMD MODEL
guild ALIAS_CMD PACKAGE/MODEL
```

For example, the `train` alias is used to run the `train`
operation. In the example above, the following commands can be used to
train the iris model:

```
guild train
guild train iris-cnn
guild train cnn
```

## List runs

To list Guild runs, use the [](cmd:runs) or [](cmd:runs/list) command.

## Compare runs

## Delete runs

To delete a run use ``guild runs

## Recover deleted runs

## Purge deleted runs

## Run directory
