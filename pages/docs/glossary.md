## Batch, Batch run

A batch, or batch run, is a run that generates other runs. Batches are
started by running an operation with one or more batch specifiers:

- A batch file argument
- A flag range value
- A flag list value

## Batch file

A file containing one or more flag combinations, with each flag
combination being used to generate a run.

## Experiment

An experiment is a way of describing [run](#run) that generates trials
for comparison. An experiment in Guild is no different from any other
run---the term is used merely by convention where
applicable. Experiments can be single runs or batch runs.

## Model

A representation of a machine learning model that provides one or more
operations.

## Operation

A specification used to start a run.

## Range value

A flag value that specifies a range within minimim and maximum values.

## Run

An operation system process, which may or may not be running, with
associated run directory and metadata. When the operating system
process is running, the run is considered *running*. When the
operating system process is not running, the run is considere stopped
in one of three states depending on the process exit code:
*completed*, *terminated*, or *error*.

## Trial

A trial is a way of describing a run generated by a batch run. A trial
in Guild is no different from any other batch generated run---the term
is used merely by convention where applicable.
