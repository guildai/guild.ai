## Package

A Guild package is a container of [models](term:model) and
[resources](term:resource). Packages are generated using the
[](cmd:package) command, which processes the contents of a [package
file](term:package-file) to create package distribution. Package
distributions may be uploaded where they can be discovered using the
[](cmd:search) command and installed using [](cmd:install).

For more information, see [Packages](/docs/packages/).
