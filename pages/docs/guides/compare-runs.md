# Compare runs with Guild

[TOC]

Guild supports a variety of techniques for comparing runs. You may
want to compare runs for a variety of reasons:

- Find the training run with the lowest loss or highest accuracy
- Compare hyperparameters and other configuration to understand why an
  operation failed or succeeded
- Compare output generated by runs

In this guide we compare runs generated by an object detector.

## Requirements
