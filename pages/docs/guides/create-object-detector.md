# Create an object detector

[TOC]

In this guide we create an object detector using support from
[gpkg.object-detect](pkg:object-detect). We demonstrate a number of
Guild features that accelerate model development and automate
workflow:

- Reuse high-level model configuration from `gpkg.object-detect`
- Automate workflow steps used to train, finetune and deploy a
  state-of-the-art object detector
