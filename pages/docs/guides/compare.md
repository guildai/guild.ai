# Compare Runs

[TOC]

Guild supports a variety of techniques for comparing runs. You may
want to compare runs for a variety of reasons:

- Find the training run with the lowest loss or highest accuracy
- Compare hyperparameters and other configuration to understand why an
  operation failed or succeeded
- Compare output generated by runs

For more information, see help for the following commands:

[](cmd:compare)
: Compare run loss and accuracy.

[](cmd:diff)
: Diff two runs.

[](cmd:view)
: Open Guild View, which supports run exploration and comparison.

[](cmd:tensorboard)
: Open TensorBoard, which supports run scalar comparison.
