Guild AI is designed to simplify complex TensorFlow operations. This
is great when everything works as expected. But what if you need to
know exactly what Guild is doing?

- Guild philosophy of light wrapping
- Overview of models and operations
- Example of running a complex operation
- Use of --print-cmd to see what Guild will run
- Use of --print-env to see what environment variables will be used
- Use of --run-dir when working on a specific problem
- Use of --stage to setup a run directory without running
