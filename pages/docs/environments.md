# Environments

A Guild environment is a Python virtual environment used to isolate
models and runs. Each environment is a separate file system directory
that contains its own set of runs and Python packages.

Environments generally correspond to a project workflow. We recommend
using them for your work with Guild as they provide a number of
benefits:

- Restrict models to those you're interested in working with
- Isolate runs associated with a particular project or worflow
- Minimize software package version conflicts and broken dependencies
