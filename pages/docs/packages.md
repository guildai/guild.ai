# Packages

[TOC]

A ***package*** is a container for [models](term:model) and
[resources](term:resource). Packages let developers easily publish
their work for users to discover. They let users easily find, install,
and use models. Packages are the central feature of Guild's support
for model collaboration, sharing and reuse.

## Find packages

You can find Guild packages in various ways:

- Visit Guild's [model repository](/models/)
- Search for a model using the [](cmd:search) command

For example, to find models that support the ImageNet dataset, simply run:

``` shell
guild search imagenet
```

New models are being published all the time so if you don't find what
you're looking for, let the community know by [submitting a request on
Guild's issue tracker](alias:guild-issues).

It's also easy to create and publish your own models.
