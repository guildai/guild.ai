## Professional Services

Guild AI provides data scientists and ML engineering experts to help
you build effective and efficient ML systems.

### <img src="/assets/icons/maps-pin.svg" height="28" style="margin-top:-8px"> Problem Definition and Assessment

Before investing in data engineering and model development, verify
that you've identified solvable problems that are meaningful to your
organization. What is current state-of-the-art for the tasks you want
to perform? Do you have access to enough of the right data? What will
it cost to get the data? Guild AI can help you answer these questions
and position your project for success during implementation.

### <img src="/assets/icons/database-hand.svg" height="30" style="margin-top:-6px"> Data Engineering

Without the right data, you can't build useful models. This often an
under-appreciated fact when building ML-enabled
applications. Effective data engineering requires data science
expertise and creativity to obtain the right raw data and transform
them into learnable features. Guild AI offers years of experience in
data engineering and can help orient your project for success in model
development phases.

### <img src="/assets/icons/file-code-refresh.svg" height="30" style="margin-top:-6px;model-right:2px"> Model Development

Model development recevies most of the attention when building ML
applications. However, model development is an iterative process
intricately related to problem definition and data engineering
efforts. As you experiment with different data sets and model
architectures, you continually consider and expore alternatives and
refine your pipelines. Guild AI specializes in this process and can
help build model development best practices in your organization.

### <img src="/assets/icons/hierarchy-2.svg" height="26" style="margin-top:-6px;margin-right:8px">Pipeline Development

Pipelines are continuous processes that build and verify models. They
can be simple, such as Guild AI enabled project, or complex, such as a
distributed containerized build system in Kubernetes. Guild AI offers
deep engineering capabilities to help scope and build the right ML
pipelines for your organization.

### <img src="/assets/icons/monitor-heart-beat-search.svg" height="32" style="margin-top:-6px;margin-right:6px">Application Monitoring and Support

ML applications require ongoing monitoring and improvement. Underlying
processes change, new data arrive, and state-of-the-art
improves. These changes have important implications for running
systems. Without proper monitoring, predictive performance can fall
without being noticed, exposing your organization to risk of unhappy
users or regulatory violations. Guild AI can help you identify
application monitoring and support requirements at the start of a
project and support your organization through development and ongoing
operations.
