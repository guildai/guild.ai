# Command Line Interface

Guild's primary interface is via the command line. Guild also supports
a [Python interface for work in Jupyter Notebooks](/notebooks.md).

As an engineering tool, Guild fits the ecosystem of traditional POSIX
toolchains. This has a number of benefits:

- Commands are run as OS processes, which interface with a host of
  tools via standard input/output, file indirections, command
  arguments and exit codes
- Commands are programming language agnostic
- Commands can be integrated into most development environments

If you're not familiar with running commands from a terminal, we
suggest reading one of the following guides for your platform.
