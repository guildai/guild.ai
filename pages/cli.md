Guild's primary interface is via the command line. Guild also supports
a [Python interface for work in Jupyter
Notebooks](guides/notebooks/).

As an engineering tool, Guild fits the ecosystem of traditional POSIX
toolchains. This has a number of benefits:

- Commands are run as OS processes, which interface with a host of
  tools via standard input/output, file indirections, command
  arguments and exit codes
- Commands are programming language agnostic
- Commands can be integrated into most development environments

While it can take time and effort to learn command line techniques, we
feel the benefits are well worth the investment.

If you're not familiar with running commands from a terminal, we
suggest reading one of the following guides for your platform.
