# Magic

Guild AI generally follows the principles outlined in Tim Peter's
excellent [PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python
->](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). One of those
principles is:

> Explicit is better than implicit.

However, in some cases, Guild goes out of its way to support implicit
--- even magical --- behavior.
